# TOFO

**Features that would be nice to have:**

- Get inputs automatically via HTTP
- Send solutions automatically via HTTP
- Create new solution files automatically (with a template to get the input)
- Add many cool things to the README.md based on the [Awesome Advent of Code repository](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code).
- Testsuite for the solutions
